  <div class="paragraph">
  <p>
    Nature is the creation of natural material and physical world on earth independent of the human activities. The beauty and richness of nature is diverse and massive. Nature provides us with several delicacies to enjoy and is our life support system. Our basic needs like food, shelter, water and air are all the gifts from nature. Humans have a strong connection and interrelation with nature. Escaping away in the nature heals the mind and body and soothes our soul. Irrespective of what nature provides us it is also our moral and social responsibility to nurture nature.

 <!-- Second paragraph about nature -->
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>
      Nature refers to the physical world and all forms of life species on earth in general. Our natural ecosystem is the community of biotic and abiotic components. The biotic components are the living organisms that also include humans. Abiotic components are the non-living components such as air, water, minerals and soil. The biotic and abiotic components are interrelated and interact with each other through energy flow.

      Natural ecosystem also includes the interrelation between diverse organisms and their environment. Natural ecosystem obtains energy primarily from sun through photosynthesis. Through the process of photosynthesis plants obtain energy from sunlight and absorb carbon dioxide from atmosphere. Plants combine carbon dioxide and water to produce oxygen and carbohydrates. The energy obtained by plants is consumed by animals. Animals also play important role in nutrient cycle and flow of energy. They influence plants and other micro-organisms in the ecosystem. Thus the energy enters ecosystem through the process of photosynthesis and is transferred to the living organisms. Thus, natural ecosystem supports life on earth.
